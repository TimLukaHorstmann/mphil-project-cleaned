For this project, this folder contained two files:
1. "node_constants.py": script containing the defined regular expressions to be used by the snippeting algorithm for the identification of the "character type" of a page
2. "note_utils.py": script containing RegGenome's snippeting algorithm. Consumes "node_constants.py"

Since these two pieces of code are the property of RegGenome and were only made available for use in the context of this work, this code cannot be included here.
Please refer to Section 3.2 of the report for more details on the snippeting algorithm and its functionality.

The below is the structure of the xml files shared by RegGenome for this project
Due to confidentiality, the files are not made available.


xml
document id=, annotation=, title= // info about the pdf document
    pages   // pages of the pdf document
        page index= // one page of the pdf
            blocks // as defined/extracted by pymupdf
                block
                    text
                    tags
                        tag
            annotation  // as defined by human annotators
                region id, x, y, width, height
                    text
                    tags
                        tag


Note:
- typically, only the regions are annotated with text, as they are created when human annotators manually identify regions in the pdf file, capturing the relevant text and annotate them
- in this data format: block structure of document (as given/created by pymupdf) is labelled with the same tag based on Jaccard similarity
(i.e. the text elements of both are compared and if the block's text passes a certain similarity value threshold when compare with the region's text, it is assigned the same label)
